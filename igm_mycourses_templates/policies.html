    <h2>Assignment Feedback and Grading</h2>
    <p>It takes time to grade assignments and provide useful feedback &ndash; much more time than students may expect. Large assignments may take up to 3 weeks to be fully graded.</p>

    <h3>Late Policy</h3>
    <p>Except in documented extenuating circumstances, exceptions to assignment late policies will not be made for any reason. This is a college class and you are expected to manage your time wisely. If you are having problems with an assignment or have an emergency that may make you late in submitting your work, contact me as soon as possible (ideally BEFORE the due date).</p>

    <h3>Challenging Grades</h3>
    <p>If you challenge a grade, it must be done in a timely manner, within a week of the return of an assignment. Remember that in challenging a grade, the instructor reserves the right to revisit the grading on the entire assignment and may adjust the grade appropriately. This is mentioned not to discourage a student with a legitimate complaint over a grade, but to rather address the often-blatant problem of &ldquo;point weaseling&rdquo; on assignments.</p>
    <p>At the end of the semester, any questions about the final grading of the course should be raised immediately. Department policy states that a student has one semester to challenge any grade.</p>

    <h3>Incomplete Policy</h3>
    <p>Incomplete (&ldquo;I&rdquo;) grades are reserved for cases in which the student is making credible course progress, and then something occurs in the student&rsquo;s life that prevents the completion of the course. Incomplete grades are not a mechanism to delay a failing grade nor are they a means to stave off probation or a suspension. For an instructor to grant an incomplete, credible documentation must be provided at the instructor&rsquo;s or school&rsquo;s request.</p>

    <h2>Class Etiquette</h2>
    <p>Due to time constraints, it is important that you join class each day prepared to work. There will be times when we will discuss topics and issues in the form of a lecture. During this time in the class, you will be expected to take notes about the material being presented. I highly recommend taking hand-written notes during class. During the lecture time, you are also encouraged to ask questions about the topics being discussed or the supplemental readings you have completed.</p>

    <h3>University Guidance for Health/Safety in the Classroom</h3>
    <p>Faculty will provide details about information specific to specialized classrooms or labs in alignment with overall University policies. Any concerns with these policies should be addressed to faculty or department offices.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIT Safety Plan</a> for details about health/safety policies that apply university-wide. </p>

    <h3>Missing Class</h3>
    <p>In the case of an illness or unexpected absence, the student should try to communicate with the faculty in as timely of a manner as possible. When class is missed, it is up to the student to make up work and to acquire any course materials. Absences in any form do not postpone due dates unless agreed upon by the instructor.</p>

    <h3>Class Cancellation</h3>
    <p>If the faculty cannot attend a class session, students will be contacted via email and cancellation signs will be placed on classroom doors. Explicit instructions for cancellation will be communicated via myCourses and your RIT e-mail.</p>

    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
    <p>As an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. RIT encourages all students to become familiar with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/p030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIT Honor Code</a> and with <a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIT&rsquo;s Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>The Department of Interactive Games and Media does not condone any form of academic dishonesty. Any act of improperly representing another person&rsquo;s work as one&rsquo;s own (or allowing someone else to represent your work as their own) is construed as an act of academic dishonesty. These acts include but are not limited to, plagiarism in any form or use of information and materials not authorized by the instructor during an examination or for any assignment.</p>
    <p>If a faculty member judges a student to be guilty of any form of academic dishonesty, the student will receive a FAILING GRADE FOR THE COURSE. Academic dishonesty involving the abuse of RIT computing facilities may result in the pursuit of more severe action.</p>
    <p>If the student believes the action by the instructor to be incorrect or the penalty too severe, the faculty member will arrange to meet jointly with the student and with the faculty member&rsquo;s immediate supervisor. If the matter cannot be resolved at this level, an appeal may be made to the GCCIS Academic Conduct Committee.</p>
    <p>If the faculty member or the faculty member&rsquo;s immediate supervisor feels that the alleged misconduct warrants more severe action than failure in the course, the case may be referred to the GCCIS Academic Conduct Committee. The Academic Conduct Committee can recommend further action to the dean of the student&rsquo;s college including academic suspension or dismissal from the Institute.</p>
    <p>The following definitions will be used to clarify and explain unacceptable conduct. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of specific actions but a reasonable description to guide one&rsquo;s actions.</p>
    <p>CHEATING includes knowingly using, buying, stealing, transporting or soliciting in whole or part the contents of an administered/unadministered test, test key, homework solution, paper, project, software project or computer program, or any other assignment. It also includes using, accessing, altering, or gaining entry to information held in a computer account or disk owned by another.</p>
    <p>COLLUSION means unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing written work or computer work (including electronic media) offered for credit. The final work submitted by a student must be substantially the work of that student. Collaboration on an assignment is expressly forbidden unless it is explicitly designated as a group project. When there is any doubt, a student should consult the instructor (NOT ANOTHER STUDENT) as to whether some action is considered collusion.</p>
    <p>Whenever there is any question as to whether a particular action is considered academic dishonesty, the instructor should be consulted.</p>

    <h2>Title IX</h2>
    <p>Title IX violations are taken very seriously at RIT. RIT is committed to investigate complaints of sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct, and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to stop the behavior, prevent its recurrence and remedy its effects. Please view the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/fa/compliance/content/title-ix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title IX Rights &amp; Resources at RIT.</a></p>
    <p>RIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT&rsquo;s policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT&rsquo;s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to them in person or shared by students as part of their coursework.</p>
