<h2 id="rit">Relevant RIT Policies</h2>
<p>Our course policies and code of conduct are based on several university wide policies and procedures. It is important that you are familiar with all of these!</p>
<h3 id="dei">Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect</h3>
<p>RIT has put forth <a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/p050">Policy P05.0 Diversity Statement</a> for all community members. If you have suggestions on how the course can better uphold these principles, I encourage you to reach out to me or a TA.</p>
<div class="card card-standard">
<div class="card-body">
<p><em>RIT through its policies and practices is responsible for building an inclusive environment where membership in the community allows for faculty, staff and students to reach their fullest potential, both professionally and personally. RIT is committed to the development, administration and interpretation of policies and procedures in a way that is consistent with our commitment to diversity and is in compliance with federal, state and local laws. RIT’s policies and procedures are administered in a way that supports fair treatment for all faculty, staff, students, and the RIT community at large.</em></p>

<h3 id="academic">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>As an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. RIT encourages all students to become familiar with RIT's <a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d080" title="&nbsp;Academic Integrity Policy">&nbsp;Academic Integrity Policy</a>, <a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/p030" title="Honor Code">Honor Code</a>, and <a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d180" title="Student Conduct Policy">Student Conduct Policy</a>.</p>
<p>As described in RIT's academic integrity policy, a breach of student academic integrity falls into three basic areas: cheating, duplicate submission and plagiarism.</p>
<p>This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of specific actions but a reasonable description to guide one’s actions. Whenever there is any question as to whether a particular action is considered academic dishonesty, a student should consult the instructor (NOT ANOTHER STUDENT) as to whether some action is considered collusion.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Cheating</strong></em>: Cheating is any form of fraudulent or deceptive academic act, including falsification of data, possessing, providing, or using unapproved materials, sources, or tools for a project, exam, or body of work submitted for faculty evaluation.</li>
<li><em><strong>Duplicate Submission</strong></em>: Duplicate submission is the submitting of the same or similar work for credit in more than one course without prior approval of the instructors for those same courses. <em>This includes submission of your own past work from a past course or a previous attempt at this course!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Plagiarism</strong></em>: Plagiarism is the representation of others’ ideas as one’s own without giving proper attribution to the original author or authors. Plagiarism occurs when a student copies direct phrases from a text (e.g. books, journals, and internet) and does not provide quotation marks or paraphrases or summarizes those ideas without giving credit to the author or authors. In all cases, if such information is not properly and accurately documented with appropriate credit given, then the student has committed plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a faculty member judges a student to be guilty of any form of academic dishonesty, the student will receive a FAILING GRADE FOR THE COURSE. Academic dishonesty involving the abuse of RIT computing facilities may result in the pursuit of more severe action.</p>
<p>If the student believes the action by the instructor to be incorrect or the penalty too severe, the faculty member will arrange to meet jointly with the student and with the faculty member’s immediate supervisor. If the matter cannot be resolved at this level, an appeal may be made to the GCCIS Academic Conduct Committee.</p>
<p>If the faculty member or the faculty member’s immediate supervisor feels that the alleged misconduct warrants more severe action than failure in the course, the case may be referred to the GCCIS Academic Conduct Committee. The Academic Conduct Committee can recommend further action to the dean of the student’s college including academic suspension or dismissal from the Institute.</p>
<h3 id="titleix">Title IX</h3>
<p>Title IX violations are taken very seriously at RIT. RIT is committed to investigate complaints of sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct, and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to stop the behavior, prevent its recurrence and remedy its effects. Please view the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/fa/compliance/content/title-ix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title IX Rights &amp; Resources at RIT.</a></p>
<p>RIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT’s policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to them in person or shared by students as part of their coursework.</p>

<h3 id="copyright">Use of Copyrighted Material</h3>
<p>Certain materials used in this course are protected by copyright and may not be copied or distributed by students. You can find more information at <a href="http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/sectionC/C3_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/sectionC/C3_2.html</a>.</p>
<p>When sharing copyrighted content on the internet with your classmates, please make sure that you link to a legal source. Repeated access to illegal sources may cause you or your classmates to receive warnings through the Copyright Alert System, as well as possible downgrades in internet service.</p>
<h2 id="names">Names &amp; Pronouns</h2>
<p>Many people go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this course, we seek to address everyone in the manner that best respects their identity. You are invited (publicly or privately) to share the name and pronouns you wish us to use and when/how we should use them.</p>
<p class="tab"><em>For example, while some professors will want you to use "Professor" or "Dr." with their last name, Prof. Mesh is comfortable with you all using her first name, "Erika", in casual conversations. In written correspondence, please use "Prof. Mesh" and the pronouns she/her when referring to her (i.e. emails, course evals, etc.).</em></p>
<p>Additionally, you can change your "preferred name" in other RIT systems by going to the <a href="https://start.rit.edu/">https://start.rit.edu/</a>&nbsp;--&gt; Directory Information --&gt; Name Preferences Page.</p>
<p class="tab"><em>Note that changing your Preferred Name will change your display name on some mail that goes to home addresses as well as RIT Email, RIT Directories, myCourses, Zoom, Early Alert, SIS, and other campus systems with data feeds from SIS. Only change your Preferred Name if you would like to change it for ALL of these RIT uses.</em></p>
<p>If you would like your name changed in legal documents (transcripts, etc.), complete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/registrar/change-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this form</a> and return it to the Registrar's Office.</p>
<h2 id="course">Course Code of Conduct</h2>
<h4>At all times:</h4>
<ul>
<li>No one is born knowing everything, <em>kindly </em>teach it to each other</li>
<li>Be competitive with yourself, not others</li>
<li>Encourage experimentation and creativity</li>
<li>Empower people to solve their own problems</li>
<li>Demonstrate how much you can help, not how much you know</li>
<li>When in doubt, ask questions, someone else is probably wondering too</li>
<li>When talking about someone, say nothing you wouldn't say directly to them</li>
<li>Be mindful of who else is in the lab and your impact on the space</li>
<li>Do NOT do someone's work for them (this ruins the learning process)</li>
<li>Do NOT explain exactly how to solve a problem (this ruins the learning process)</li>
<li>Do NOT use any discriminatory language. <em>You will be asked to leave and may face other academic punishments. I have ZERO tolerance for discrimination.</em></li>
<li>DO have fun. You can do a lot of fun stuff in this course if you're willing to try and this is a great opportunity to get to know your classmates!</li>
</ul>
<h4>In Slack</h4>
<p>Within the Slack workspace, all RIT rules still apply and we reserve the right to remove anyone at any time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT share large sections of code. Posts such as “Please debug this” and “Here’s my solution” will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy.</li>
<li>DO ask questions about concepts, homework clarifications, etc.</li>
<li>DO feel free to answer questions from your peers.</li>
<li>DO ask yourself if your message is respectful and constructive.</li>
<li>DO share links or examples that seem useful.</li>
<li>DO use #random and other general channels to get to know us and your peers!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="safety">Health/Safety in the Classroom</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIT Safety Plan</a> and <a href="https://www.rit.edu/ready/community-expectations">Community Expectations</a> for details about health/safety policies that apply university-wide.</p>
<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>Food and drink are not permitted in the computer labs.&nbsp; Food and drink have already been prohibited for years before covid due to the nature of spilling liquids on expensive lab computers (yes, it has happened!) or using greasy fingers on keyboards (eww).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ONLY exception is: a beverage in a closed, <em>spill-proof</em> container with a straw or spout</strong>.&nbsp; A strong, structured bottle that contains the beverage and a sturdy straw will work.&nbsp; If you are a hot beverage drinker, keep an insulated tumbler with you.&nbsp; No, a paper cup with a plastic straw from Salsarita's or Midnight Oil does not count. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Need some suggestions on acceptable cup types?&nbsp; Check these out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silicone straw:&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2usu9nz6">https://tinyurl.com/2usu9nz6</a></li>
