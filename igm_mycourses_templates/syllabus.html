                <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                <p>This semester, I am teaching XXX sections of this course. To facilitate consistency, all sections have been "merged" into a single myCourses shell. Unless otherwise stated, all due dates, etc. will be the same for all of my sections.</p>
                <p>However, each section will meet at their assigned time. As such, <strong>please</strong> make sure you know in which section you are enrolled and when it meets.</p>

        <h2>Course Elements</h2>
        <p><strong>ALL work in this course will be individual efforts only!</strong></p>
        <h3>Topic Quizzes (15%)</h3>
        <p>Most new concepts discussed in class will be followed by a short quiz in myCourses to assess your initial understanding of the topic.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grading:</strong> All quizzes, regardless of the exact number of questions, will be weighted equally. <em>myCourses has been configured to drop the lowest 2 quiz grades.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Submission:</strong> Quizzes will be submitted and graded via the myCourses Quizzes tool. <em>Please make sure to always "Submit" the quiz. Attempts left "in progress" will not be graded!</em></li>
            <li><strong>Due Dates &amp; Late Policy:</strong> &nbsp;Unless otherwise stated, all quizzes are due at 11:59pm ET on the due date (usually 1 week later).
                <ul>
                    <li>Late quizzes will not be accepted except under clear extenuating circumstances.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Practice Exercises (15%)</h3>
        <p>Practice exercises (PEs) will be assigned most days, directly following that day’s lecture. These exercises task you with practicing the topic of the day and potentially incorporating previously learned material. You are given time in class to begin the exercise, as well as ask questions about the day’s topic or specific issues with your code.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grading:</strong> All PEs, regardless of the complexity, will be weighted equally and graded based on a live demo and code walkthrough in class with your TA or instructor.&nbsp;<em>myCourses has been configured to drop the lowest 2 PE grades.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Submission:</strong> There will be no myCourses submission for PEs. Grades will be based on your ability to discuss your solution and demo the working PE to your instructor or TA.</li>
            <li><strong>Due Dates &amp; Late Policy:</strong> Unless otherwise stated, PEs must be presented to the instructor or TA by the end of the next class period.
                <ul>
                    <li>More complex PEs may have slightly extended due dates.</li>
                    <li>Late PE checkoffs will not be accepted. Show us whatever you've got by the due date for partial credit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Homeworks (25%)</h3>
        <p>Out-of-class programming assignments are an integral part of this course. In general, these projects will be more complicated and take longer than the practice exercises. It is important that you read the details of the assignment as soon as it is made available and plan your time accordingly. If you have questions or need help, please reach out to us as soon as possible!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grading:</strong> Projects are graded out of 100 points as per the rubric given with the assignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Submission:</strong> All homework submissions will be done via GitHub tagged releases. The assignment must be committed, pushed, and released in your GitHub repository by 11:59pm ET on the due date. <em>We will cover how to use and submit via GitHub in class.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Due Dates &amp; Late Policy:</strong>&nbsp;You will generally have 1-2 weeks to complete each homework assignment. Late homework assignments will lose 10% off the final grade per day.
                <ul>
                    <li>This means if you would have gotten a 92, but submitted anywhere between 1 second and 24 hours late, you will receive an 82.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Homework Grace Periods:</strong> Up to twice in the semester, you may request, no questions asked, a 2-day grace period to submit your homework assignment late.
                <ul>
                    <li>A "grace period" allows a student some wiggle room in a homework assignment submission without a late penalty. For example, if a homework assignment is due on Sunday night and a student submits it on Tuesday, there is an automatic 20% (twenty point) deduction on the grade. However, a grace period would result in a Tuesday submission having no late penalty. &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>All students have 2 two-day grace periods to use this semester! These are yours to use at your discretion. You do not need to ask permission or explain why, and they are use-it-or-lose-it.</li>
                    <li>Certain procedures must be followed to use a grace period. To use a grace period, please:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note it within the comments of an assignment submission.</li>
                            <li>Send a Slack DM to the instructor and teaching assistants notifying us<em> (Yes, all of us in a group DM!)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
