                <h2>Contact Information & Office Hours</h2>
                <p>The TAs and I will hold regular office hours each week. Office hours offer you the opportunity to ask individual questions about the course material that you may have not had time to have addressed in class.</p>
                <p>Office hours are held on a first-come-first-served drop-in basis. No appointment is necessary to attend office hours.</p>
                <p>Sometimes office hours become increasingly busy the closer it is to a project deadline. If we have a line of students waiting, we will limit discussions to 10 minutes/student. Plan your use of office hours accordingly.</p>

                <p>Individual appointments may be arranged with me at other times via Starfish.</p>

                <h2>Contact Policy</h2>

                <h3>General Questions or Discussions</h3>
                <p> If you have general questions about the course or an assignment that are not covered in these course documents, please post your questions to a public channel in Slack so all students can benefit from the answer. If, as a student, you can answer a question posed, I encourage you to reply to your classmate.</p>
                <p>If you have a question about your particular implementation, grade, etc, please email me.</p>

                <h3>Personal Topics</h3>
                <p><strong>All official communications should occur between your RIT e-mail address and the faculty’s RIT e-mail address.</strong> Furthermore, faculty may not be able to respond to requests that do not originate from an RIT e-mail. Please make sure to use only the email address noted above. I do have others associated with RIT, but I do NOT check them regularly!</p>

                <p>Always include a subject line and be sure to mention the class name and section. It’s also expected that you use complete sentences and punctuation, as well as sign your name.</p>

                <p>Announcements and other messages may also be sent using the facilities for sending mass emails available in myCourses. Since you may request re-grades of work only within a set period from the time that the feedback was provided to you, and course announcements could provide you with important information, it is in your best interest to read your RIT e-mail account daily.</p>

                <p>I check my email frequently; this is usually the fastest way to reach me. If you do not receive a response from me within 24 hours, Monday-Friday, contact me again as it is likely I missed your first message. Emails delivered over the weekend may take slightly longer for a response.</p>

                <h3>myCourses Announcements</h3>
                <p>I will provide any course announcements through the Announcements on the Course Home Page. This includes any updates or changes to assignments or other course assignments, as well as general comments about assignment results or discussions.

                    <strong>Please check your RIT e-mail & myCourses daily for important notifications</strong>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Slack</h3>
<p><strong>Slack is NOT a replacement for attending class, studying, doing assignments, posting major questions in the Discussion forums, or office hours!</strong></p>
<p>Slack is a way to <em>extend our time together and build community</em> in a more casual way - especially since we cannot hang out after class, in my office, etc.</p>
<p>You can contact me through email if you would like to discuss something privately, but for quick general discussions, I would prefer you use Slack that way everyone can stay connected. Within the Slack workspace, all RIT rules still apply and we reserve the right to remove anyone at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>Some rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT do someone's work for them (this ruins the learning process).</li>
<li>Do NOT explain exactly how to solve a problem (this ruins the learning process).</li>
<li>Do NOT use any discriminatory language. You will be banned from the server for that and may face other academic punishments. I have ZERO tolerance for discrimination.</li>
<li>Do NOT share large sections of code. Posts such as &ldquo;Please debug this&rdquo; and &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my solution&rdquo; will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy.</li>
<li>DO ask yourself if your message is respectful. If it's disrespectful against any individual or group, you will see consequences.</li>
<li>DO ask questions about concepts, homework clarifications, etc.</li>
<li>DO share links or examples that seem useful.</li>
<li>DO have fun. You can do a lot of fun stuff in this course if you're willing to try and this is a great opportunity to get to know your classmates!</li>
</ul>
